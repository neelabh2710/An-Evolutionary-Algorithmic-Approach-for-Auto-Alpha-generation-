Automated Alpha Generation using Genetic Algorithm
This project implements a Genetic Algorithm framework for Automated Alpha Generation using the WorldQuant platform API. It incorporates diverse data sources like Price Volume Data for Equities, Risk 68, and the Growth Valuation Matrix to create alpha signals. The algorithm utilizes Elitism to address bloating issues and enhance conversion rates, resulting in a peak Sharpe ratio of 4.02 and a maximum return of 80% within the universe of US and Chinese Top 3000 equities.
